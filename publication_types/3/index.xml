      <description>We extend TinyMPC, an open-source, high-speed solver targeting low-power embedded control applications, to provide support for second-order cones, as well as &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; code generation from &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MATLAB&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; for easy deployment. Microcontroller benchmarks show that our solver provides up to a two-order-of-magnitude speedup, ranging from 10.6x to 142.7x, over state-of-the-art embedded solvers on QP and SOCP problems, and enables us to fit order-of-magnitude larger problems in memory. We validate our solver&amp;rsquo;s deployed performance through simulation and hardware experiments, including conically-constrained trajectory tracking on a 27g Crazyflie quadrotor. To get started with Conic-TinyMPC, visit our documentation, examples, and the open-source codebase at &lt;a href=&#34;https://tinympc.org/&#34;&gt;tinympc.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>TAG-K: Tail-Averaged Greedy Kaczmarz for Computationally Efficient and Performant Online Inertial Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://a2r-lab.github.io/publication/kaczmarz/</link>

      <description>We introduce TAG-K, a lightweight extension of the Kaczmarz method that combines greedy randomized row selection for rapid convergence with tail averaging for robustness under noise and inconsistency. This design enables fast, stable parameter adaptation while retaining the low per-iteration complexity inherent to the Kaczmarz framework. We evaluate TAG-K in synthetic benchmarks and quadrotor tracking tasks against RLS, KF, and other Kaczmarz variants. TAG-K achieves 1.5x-1.9x faster solve times on laptop-class CPUs and 4.8x-20.7x faster solve times on embedded microcontrollers. More importantly, these speedups are paired with improved resilience to measurement noise and a 25% reduction in estimation error, leading to nearly 2x better end-to-end tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Polynomial and Parallelizable Preconditioning for Block Tridiagonal Positive Definite Matrices</title>

      <description>The efficient solution of moderately large-scale linear systems arising from the KKT conditions in optimal control problems (OCPs) is a critical challenge in robotics. With the stagnation of Moore’s law, there is growing interest in leveraging GPU-accelerated iterative methods, and corresponding parallel preconditioners, to overcome these computational challenges. To improve the performance of such solvers, we introduce a parallel-friendly, parametrized multi-splitting polynomial preconditioner framework. We first construct and prove the optimal parametrization theoretically in terms of the least amount of distinct eigenvalues and the narrowest spectrum range. We then compare the theoretical time complexity of solving the linear system directly or iteratively. We finally show through numerical experiments how much the preconditioning improves the convergence of OCP linear systems solves.</description>

      <title>pRRTC: GPU-Parallel RRT-Connect for Fast, Consistent, and Low-Cost Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://a2r-lab.github.io/publication/prrtc/</link>

      <description>In this work we present pRRTC, a RRT-Connect based planner co-designed for GPU acceleration across the entire algorithm through parallel expansion and SIMT-optimized collision checking. We evaluate the effectiveness of pRRTC on the MotionBenchMaker dataset using robots with 7, 8, and 14 degrees of freedom (DoF). Compared to the state-of-the-art, pRRTC achieves as much as a 10× speedup on constrained reaching tasks with a 5.4× reduction in standard deviation. pRRTC also achieves a 1.4× reduction in average initial path cost. Finally, we deploy pRRTC on a 14-DoF dual Franka Panda arm setup and demonstrate real-time, collision-free motion planning with dynamic obstacles. We open-source our planner to support the wider community.</description>

      <title>Datasheets for Machine Learning Sensors</title>
      <link>https://a2r-lab.github.io/publication/mlsensorsdatasheet/</link>

      <guid>https://a2r-lab.github.io/publication/mlsensorsdatasheet/</guid>
      <description>This paper introduces a standard datasheet template for ML sensors and discusses its essential components inluding: the system&amp;rsquo;s hardware, ML model and dataset attributes, end-to-end performance metrics, and environmental impact. We provide an example datasheet for our own ML sensor and discuss each section in detail. We highlight how these datasheets can facilitate better understanding and utilization of sensor data in ML applications, and we provide objective measures upon which system performance can be evaluated and compared.</description>
