      <title>HJCD-IK: GPU-Accelerated Inverse Kinematics through Batched Hybrid Jacobian Coordinate Descent</title>

      <description>We introduce HJCD-IK, a GPU-accelerated, sampling-based hybrid Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver that combines an orientation-aware greedy coordinate descent initialization scheme with a Jacobian-based polishing routine. This design enables our solver to improve both convergence speed and overall accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art, consistently finding solutions along the accuracy-latency Pareto frontier and often achieving order-of-magnitude gains. In addition, our method produces a broad distribution of high-quality samples, yielding the lowest maximum mean discrepancy. We release our code open-source for the benefit of the community.</description>

      <title>pRRTC: GPU-Parallel RRT-Connect for Fast, Consistent, and Low-Cost Motion Planning</title>

      <description>In this work we present pRRTC, a RRT-Connect based planner co-designed for GPU acceleration across the entire algorithm through parallel expansion and SIMT-optimized collision checking. We evaluate the effectiveness of pRRTC on the MotionBenchMaker dataset using robots with 7, 8, and 14 degrees of freedom (DoF). Compared to the state-of-the-art, pRRTC achieves as much as a 10× speedup on constrained reaching tasks with a 5.4× reduction in standard deviation. pRRTC also achieves a 1.4× reduction in average initial path cost. Finally, we deploy pRRTC on a 14-DoF dual Franka Panda arm setup and demonstrate real-time, collision-free motion planning with dynamic obstacles. We open-source our planner to support the wider community.</description>
