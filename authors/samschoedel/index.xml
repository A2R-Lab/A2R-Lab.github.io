      <description>We extend TinyMPC, an open-source, high-speed solver targeting low-power embedded control applications, to provide support for second-order cones, as well as &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; code generation from &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MATLAB&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Julia&lt;/code&gt; for easy deployment. Microcontroller benchmarks show that our solver provides up to a two-order-of-magnitude speedup, ranging from 10.6x to 142.7x, over state-of-the-art embedded solvers on QP and SOCP problems, and enables us to fit order-of-magnitude larger problems in memory. We validate our solver&amp;rsquo;s deployed performance through simulation and hardware experiments, including conically-constrained trajectory tracking on a 27g Crazyflie quadrotor. To get started with Conic-TinyMPC, visit our documentation, examples, and the open-source codebase at &lt;a href=&#34;https://tinympc.org/&#34;&gt;tinympc.org&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>Optimizing at All Scales: Edge (Non)linear Model Predictive Control from MCUs to GPUs</title>

      <description>In our recent works, by leveraging a combination of parallelism, approximation, and structure exploitation, we have enabled and accelerated (nonlinear) trajectory optimization solvers for real-time performance on non-standard computational hardware, ranging from microcontrollers (MCUs) to graphical processing units (GPUs). This has led to real-time MPC onboard an MCU powered 27g quadrotor for dynamic obstacle avoidance, as well as simulated whole-body nonlinear MPC at kHz rates for a GPU powered manipulator for high speed trajectory tracking.</description>

      <title>TinyMPC: Model-Predictive Control on Resource-Constrained Microcontrollers</title>

      <description>Model-predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling highly dynamic robotic systems subject to complex constraints. However, MPC is computationally demanding, and is often impractical to implement on small, resource-constrained robotic platforms. We present TinyMPC, a high-speed MPC solver with a low memory footprint targeting the microcontrollers common on small robots. Our approach is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and leverages the structure of the MPC problem for efficiency. We demonstrate TinyMPC both by benchmarking against the state-of-the-art solver OSQP, achieving nearly an order of magnitude speed increase, as well as through hardware experiments on a 27 g quadrotor, demonstrating high-speed trajectory tracking and dynamic obstacle avoidance.</description>
