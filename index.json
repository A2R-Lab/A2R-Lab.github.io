science (CS) and engineering research both have large and well documented gender diversity gaps. In fact, previous studies have reported that the overall CS Female Author Ratio (FAR) is only in the range of 16-26% and varies significantly between CS subfields ranging from as high as 42% in CS Education to as low as 8% in Theory and Algorithms. To understand the current state of gender diversity of robotics, we recently collected and analyzed the gender of paper authors from all IEEE RAS fully sponsored conferences (ARSO, CASE, HAPTICS, Humanoids, ICRA, ISAM, MEMS, RoboSoft, SIMPAR, SSRR) as well as IROS and RA-L from 2019-2021. Overall, we find that robotics has a long way to go to reach gender parity, with an overall FAR of only 11-12%. We hope this analysis helps the robotics community to continue to emphasize the importance of working to improve our diversity.","tags":["Cybersecurity","Women","Gender","Representation"],"title":"Improving the Representation of Undergraduate Women in Cybersecurity: A Literature Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emre Adabag","Xueyi Bu","Khai Nguyen","Sam Schoedel","Anoushka Alavilli","Miloni Atal","William Gerard","Elakhya Nedumaran","Zachary Manchester","Brian Plancher"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1721001600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721001600,"objectID":"383e42e177c2ee7cc1bb5c2b26e90fd9","permalink":"https://a2r-lab.github.io/publication/optimizingatallscales/","publishdate":"2024-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/optimizingatallscales/","section":"publication","summary":"In our recent works, by leveraging a combination of parallelism, approximation, and structure exploitation, we have enabled and accelerated (nonlinear) trajectory optimization solvers for real-time performance on non-standard computational hardware, ranging from microcontrollers (MCUs) to graphical processing units (GPUs).

This, unfortunately, limits accessibility and diversity within these crucial areas of computer science. To combat this challenge and ignite excitement among undergraduate learners, we developed an application-driven course, harnessing robotics as a lens to demystify the intricacies of these topics making them tangible and engaging. Our course's prerequisites are limited to the required undergraduate introductory core curriculum, opening doors for a wider range of students. Our course also features a large final-project component to connect theoretical learning to applied practice. In our first offering of the course we attracted 27 students without prior experience in these topics and found that an overwhelming majority of the students felt that they learned both technical and soft skills such that they felt prepared for future study in these fields.","tags":["GPU Programming","Numerical Optimizaiton","Robotics","CS Education","Parallel Computing"],"title":"Parallel Optimization for Robotics: An Undergraduate Introduction to GPU Parallel Programming and Numerical Optimization Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Khai Nguyen","Sam Schoedel","Anoushka Alavilli","Brian Plancher","Zachary Manchester"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1715558405,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715558405,"objectID":"70114735f94a3a53b95062bb77e1517f","permalink":"https://a2r-lab.github.io/publication/tinympc/","publishdate":"2023-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tinympc/","section":"publication","summary":"Model-predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling highly dynamic robotic systems subject to complex constraints.

We are working to unlock the full potential of these tiny robots by leveraging insights from robotics, machine learning, and computer architecture / embedded systems to custom tailor algorithmic solutions through co-design.","tags":null,"title":"Next Generation Intelligence for Tiny Robots","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"89caa6f3dde3003f62c11c7b08b01799","permalink":"https://a2r-lab.github.io/projects/responsibleaccessible/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/responsibleaccessible/","section":"projects","summary":"In order to improve the accessibility of robotics and computing globally we are undertaking research to: understand and improve diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in STEM education globally; design new interdisciplinary, project-based, open-access courses that lower the barrier to entry of cutting edge topics like robotics and embedded machine learning; and collaboratively promoting a sustainable and privacy preserving future for autonomous systems and edge computing.","tags":null,"title":"Responsible and Accessible Robotics and Computing","type":"projects"}]
