reinforcement learning (DRL) is one of the most powerful tools for synthesizing complex robotic behaviors. But training DRL models is incredibly compute and memory intensive, requiring large training datasets and replay buffers to achieve performant results. This poses a challenge for the next generation of field robots that will need to learn on the edge to adapt to their environment. In this paper, we begin to address this issue through observation space quantization. We evaluate our approach using four simulated robot locomotion tasks and two state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, the on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and find that observation space quantization reduces overall memory costs by as much as 4.2x without impacting learning performance.","tags":["Robot Learning","Machine Learning","Reinforcement Learning"],"title":"Just Round: Quantized Observation Spaces Enable Memory Efficient Learning of Dynamic Locomotion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665360000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665360000,"objectID":"f13057aae603c001d77e9b19b75f76fa","permalink":"https://a2r-lab.github.io/courses/coms-bc3159-sp23/","publishdate":"2022-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/coms-bc3159-sp23/","section":"courses","summary":"Many stages of state-of-the-art robotics pipelines rely on the solutions of underlying optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, many of these approaches rely on simplifications and conservative approximations in order to reduce their computational complexity and support online operation. At the same time, parallelism has been used to significantly increase the throughput of computationally expensive algorithms across the field of computer science. And, with the widespread adoption of parallel computing platforms such as GPUs, it is natural to consider whether these architectures can benefit robotics researchers interested in solving computationally constrained problems online. This course will provide students with an introduction to both parallel programming on CPUs and GPUs as well as optimization algorithms for robotics applications.

Many are then community or individually maintained. However, these tools often find limited adoption beyond their creators. As a result, it is common for many of the same functionalities to be re-implemented by different instructional groups within the CS Education community. We hypothesize that this is due in part to accessibility, discoverability, and adaptability challenges, among others. Further, instructors often face institutional barriers to deployment, which can include hesitance of institutions to utilize community developed solutions that often lack a centralized authority. This working group will explore what solutions are currently available, what instructors need, and reasons behind the above-mentioned phenomenon.","tags":["STEM Education","CS Education","Open Source"],"title":"Leveraging Community Software in CS Education to Avoid Reinventing the Wheel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Víctor Mayoral-Vilches","Sabrina M.
