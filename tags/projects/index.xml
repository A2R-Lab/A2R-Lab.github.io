      <description>This course is designed to explore topics and skills needed for the successful completion of large computer science projects. This will be done through a mix of lecture and group work led by both the course instructor as well as guest instructors from both industry and academia. Students will exercise their development of these skills by applying them in the context of a project. &lt;strong&gt;For Spring 2023, students are expected to bring a project to the course.&lt;/strong&gt; The course staff will be able to provide general support for projects but may not have the technical expertise to support projects in depth. &lt;strong&gt;As such, these projects will ideally already have a (technical) mentor or client sponsor who can support the student.&lt;/strong&gt; To document their projects and begin to build their personal portfolio, students will (learn how to and) develop a website, report, and presentation about both the final result of their project as well as the journey taken.</description>
