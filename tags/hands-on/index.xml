      <description>This course is designed as a companion for independent projects taken on by undergraduate students. Students are expected to bring a project to the course. These projects will ideally already have a technical mentor who can support the student through the project. This course, and its weekly meetings, are designed to provide additional support and guidance on top of that existing technical support. Each week we will also survey a topic that will be crucial for students&#39; future careers in both academia and industry. This will be done through a mix of lecture and group work led by both the course instructor as well as guest instructors from industry and academia. To document their projects and begin to build their personal portfolio, students will (learn how to and) develop a website, report, and presentation about both the final result of their project as well as the journey taken to get to their final result.</description>

      <description>Robots are cyber-physical systems – leveraging computational intelligence to sense and interact with the real world. As such, robotics is a very diverse, cross-disciplinary field. This introductory course exposes learners to the vast opportunities and challenges posed by the interdisciplinary nature of robotics. While grounded and focused in computation this course also explores hands-on electromechanical and ethical topics that are an integral part of a real-world robotic system. Topics will include: a survey of the algorithmic robotics pipeline (perception, mapping, localization, planning, control, and learning), an introduction to cyber-physical system design, and responsible AI. The course will culminate in a team-based final project.</description>
